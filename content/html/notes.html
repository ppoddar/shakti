Shakti Chattopadhaya is <em>enfant terrible</em>
in rich heritage of Bengali poetry. 
<p>
His angry refusal of urban hypocrisy 
had resonated with urban youth, especially the rebels.
However, lyrical quality of his poems -- deeply
rooted in beauty of rural Bengal -- had surpassed
angst in his writings. 
<p>
As a homage to this great poet, this is a 
collection of his poems translated for
international lovers of poetry.

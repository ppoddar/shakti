<h3 class="title">Not a Happy Hour</h3>

Body trembles from head to toe <br>
Wall meets wall, cornice to cornice<br>
Pavement swaps at midnight<br><br>

Time to return home<br>
Home inside home, feet inside feet, heart inside heart<br>
Nothing more...or something more than that?<br><br>

Body trembles from head to toe <br>
Wall meets wall, cornice to cornice<br>
Pavement swaps at midnight<br><br>

Time to return home<br>
Home inside home, feet inside feet, heart inside heart<br>
Nothing more.<br><br>

"Hands Up!" lift your hands<br>
Till someone picks you up<br>
Inside a black van<br>
Black van inside black van, inside bigger van<br>
Windows, doors and graves in rows<br>
Haphazard skeletons<br><br>

White mite inside skeleton<br>
Life inside mite<br>
Death inside life -- hence<br>
Death inside death<br>
Nothing more.<br><br>

"Hands Up!": lift your hand<br>
Till someone throws you off a van<br>
But inside a bigger van<br>
Where someone waits, always<br>
With tight grips of saplings on mortar <br>
Someone unknown<br>
Waits with garland in hand<br>
Like a flower inside a hard bud<br>
As spider's golden web<br>
She will garland you<br>
Your wedding is at midnight<br>
When pavement swaps, body trembles from head to toe<br>
Wall meets wall, cornice to cornice<br><br>

Imagine carriages standing, stations running<br>
Imagine shoes walking, feet are still<br>
Imagine the craziest things<br>
Babies carrying corpses, rushing to pyre<br>
Deceased waltzing across river of death.<br><br>

That was not happy hour, not moment of joy<br>
Body trembles from head to toe<br>
Wall meets wall, cornice to cornice<br>
Pavement swaps at midnight<br><br>

Hour of coming home<br>
Home inside home, feet inside feet, heart inside heart<br>
Nothing more.

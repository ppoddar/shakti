<h3>Oboni, Are you home?</h3>

Neighborhood asleep <br>
Doors shut tight<br>
Night's sudden knock:<br>
"Oboni, are you home?"<br><br>

Pours here 'round the year<br>
Cattle clouds roam<br>
Dejected tall green grass<br>
Grabs the door<br>
"Oboni, are you home?"<br><br>

Faint latent pain in heart<br>
I drowse <br>
Sudden knock of the dark:<br>
"Oboni, are you home?"

The frame withered today in the room <br>
Unlike that twilight of monsoon <br>
Rain soaked flowers in the garden <br>
Melodies of Joy. <br>
<br>
The boy no more visits the greens <br>
The banyan no more weeps on his flute <br>
Still lightning strikes <br>
'midst the thunderclouds <br>
<br>
Didn't she know <br>
Moments like this <br>
Grabbed the rooster's comb? <br>
Didn't she know <br>
Waste of heart was never to be? <br>
<br>
Didn't she know <br>
This gift of gab <br>
Was not as deep as my heart? <br>
Didn't she know <br>
No one knew her as deep as I? <br>
<br>
The frame withered today in the room <br>
Unlike that twilight of monsoon <br>
Rain soaked flowers in the garden <br>
Melodies of Joy.

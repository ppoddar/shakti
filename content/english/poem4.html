<h3 class="title">Ananchist</h3>

Deep commotion ashore <br>
"Whose corpse floats on the river? <br>
Where was his home?"<br>
Night waves only ramble: <br>
"It's I, the anarchist".<br><br>

Does ocean embrace living and the dead<br>
Both so dear?<br><br>

Who knows if hemlock is the right drink, <br>
Elixir is poison?<br>
Intellect wilts day and night.<br><br>

Deep commotion ashore <br>
"Whose corpse floats on the river? <br>
Where was his home?"<br>
Night waves only ramble: <br>
"It's I, the anarchist".<br><br>

Thinking, it's time to turn back <br>
<br>
Held so much dirt in these palms <br>
Over so many years <br>
Never thought of you as you <br> 
<br>
Now next to a ravine in the night, <br>
The moon calls: <em>"Come, Come, Come"</em> <br>
Standing sleepy on Ganga's bank <br>
The wooden pyre calls: <em>"Come, Come"</em> <br> 
<br>
I may go <br>
Any which way <br>
But why? <br> 
<br>
Rather would hold my child <br>
Plant a kiss on her face <br> 
<br>
Will go <br>
But not now <br>
Will take all of you <br>
Won't depart  <br>
All of a sudden, alone

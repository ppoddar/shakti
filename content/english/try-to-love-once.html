Try to love for once <br>
You wll see rocks rolling from the river, from the heart of fish<br>
Rocks, rocks, rocks and water of river and sea<br>
Blue rock turning red, red turning blue<br>
Try to love for once <br>


Better with few rocks in the heart - calls echo
When all paths are slippery, lay the rocks 
As if the raw use of poetry, as if the waves, 
As if the decorated idols 
I can visit upto the grim door of Fall 

Better with few rocks in the heart - 
Keep the letters in the gaps of the rocks
There is no letterbox
Sometimes fees like having a home

The rocks from the fishes' heart are finding room in ours
We need everything. We wil build dwelling - we will
mount the pillars of civilization 
Silvery fish went with rocks 
Try to love for once <br>

May go, But why?
-----------------

Thinking 
It's time to turn back 

So much dirt in these hands 
Over so many years 
Never thought of you as You  

Now next to a ravine in the night 
Moon calls: "Come, Come, Come!"

Standing on Ganga's bank, sleepy 
Wooden pyre calls: "Come, Come!"  

I may go 
Whichever way 
But why?  

Rather hold my child 
To kiss her  face  

Will go, 
But not now 
Will take all of you. 
Won't go  
All of a sudden, 
Alone.

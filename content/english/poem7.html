<h3 class="title">Take me back</h3>
Why have you bring me in? <br>
Take me back. <br><br>

Let me return <br>
This face cold as dark, miser eyes sad as dry lake <br>
Touching her hand <br><br>

No more on this arid land<br>
Feet bloodied with splinters<br>
Why did you usher me in?<br>
Crushing bed of straws?<br>
Take me back.<br><br>

Smell of rotten crop, green moss,<br>
Of tri-eyed sardines<br>
All my dark senses <br>
Are in spicerack of your kitchen  <br><br>

I see no hand or feet of limbless night<br>
Where have you brought me in your decay? <br>
I see no hand or feet of limbless night.<br><br>

Soft wind blows, ocean must be close<br>
You tie me up in wrinkled grip<br>
As if I approach the shore with all my dark<br>
The sea will recede, cold will recede, <br>
Death will recede<br>
Then you might borne Death for Life<br>
Dark I am, Dark I will, or Dark I'll become<br><br>

Why have you bring me in?  <br>
Take me back.

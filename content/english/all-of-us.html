Someone was telling us stories of our lost days throughout the morning
They did not ask us to get up since the morning 
Only said to sit and listen
Stories of those days kept behind

Nobody picked up those days
You lose money, many will pick up from your back
You lose your way, a procession follow the same way
Leave a corpse behind, vultures would savour the flesh
Leave the door open, panicky woman would take the pans away
Leave the house - everything is formless illusion

You have thrown the torn shirts
Broken lantern, old papers, letters, leaves 
Someone always picks up

You will not get back those lost days 
More you go, more you will go towards death 
Others will pontificate: This is Life, This is fullfillment,
This is all
This is socientym dharma, mediation, meaning, sorrow


Someone was telling us stories of our lost days throughout the morning
They did not say where they found them
They did not admit if they had stolen those lost days, dreams
They told those brillant dreams, memories 
We felt again the lost tales those we have been losing all along
Losing in the forests, old papers, fairgrounds 
Rivers, Oceans, Beaches, Roads, Branches, Talkie Houses 
Losing in tghe stations, piers, villages
Someone's hair, someone's eyes, someones face, someone's promises
Losing, losing, losing - never to get back 

Never to get back those days filled with sunshine, storm, rain and fall 
Those naked childhood days of coin handouts  
Never to get back those days of floating paperboats in the waves of ephemeral backyard sea
Never to get back, never to get back, never to get back
Those moonlit days of falling leaves 


Someone was telling us stories of our lost days throughout the morning
We have not got anything done in the morning
We were listening the stories of our lost days, silently 
Like police
We were planning our steps like police
We are planning to send sniffer dogs for our lost days 
We were busy with random ideas
We were crossing the ravines of time 
All of a sudden, someone hollered: The carriage has arrived,
Get in, get in quck
The tiger will eat you up if you stay 
We jumped, crawled, walked to the carriage of tomorrow
We all went to the tiger there from the tiger here

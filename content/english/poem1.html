<h3 class="title">Melodies of Joy</h3>

Wilted frame in the room <br>
Unlike that twilight of monsoon <br>
Rainsoaked flowers in the garden <br>
Melodies of Joy. <br><br>

The boy comes no more to the green <br>
The banyan weeps no more on his flute <br>
Still lightning sparks <br>
'midst the thunderclouds <br><br>

Hadn't she known <br>
Moments like this <br>
Grabs the rooster's comb? <br>
Hadn't she known <br>
Waste of heart <br>
Is never to be? <br><br>

Hadn't she known <br>
This gift of gab <br>
Not as deep as my heart? <br>
Hadn't she known <br>
No one knew her <br>
As much as me? <br><br>

Wilted frame in the room <br>
Unlike that twilight of monsoon <br>
Rainsoaked flowers in the garden <br>
Melodies of Joy.

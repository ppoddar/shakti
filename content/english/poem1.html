<h3 class='title'>Melodies of Joy</h3>

Wilted frame in the room <br>
Unlike that twilight of monsoon <br>
Rain soaked flowers in the garden <br>
Melodies of Joy. <br><br>

The boy no more came to the greens <br>
The banyan no more wept on his flute <br>
Still lightning sparks <br>
'midst thunderclouds <br><br>

Hadn't she known <br>
Moments like this <br>
Grabs the rooster's comb? <br>
Hadn't she known <br>
Waste of heart, is never to be? <br><br>

Hadn't she known <br>
This gift of gab <br>
Is not as deep as my heart? <br>
Hadn't she known <br>
No one knew her as deep as I? <br><br>

Wilted frame in the room <br>
Unlike that twilight of monsoon <br>
Rain soaked flowers in the garden <br>
Melodies of Joy.

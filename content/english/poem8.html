<h3 class="title">May go, but why?</h3>

Thinking <br>
It's time to turn back <br>

So much dirt in these hands <br>
Over so many years <br>
Never thought of you as you <br> <br>

Now next to a ravine in the night <br>
Moon calls: "Come, Come, Come"" <br>

Standing on Ganga's bank, sleepy <br>
Wooden pyre calls: "Come, Come" <br> <br>

I may go <br>
Whichever way <br>
But why? <br> <br>

Rather hold my child <br>
To kiss her  face <br> <br>

Will go <br>
But not now <br>
Will take all of you <br>
Won't go  <br>
All of a sudden, <br>
Alone.

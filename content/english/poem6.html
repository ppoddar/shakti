<h3>Postmen of Forest of Fall</h3>
Seen many a postman wander in the forest of Fall<br>
Their yellow bags filled like bovine belly<br>
Picked up letters of ages past, old and new <br>
Those men in the forest of fall<br><br>
  

Seen them ceaseless<br>
Like egrets fish<br>
Mysterious, alert, agile<br><br>
Not like postmen of our times<br>
Not like hands that lose letters of our luxurious love<br><br>

We are drifting apart<br>
Going afar for lure of letters<br>
Getting more letters from far<br>
Going away from you yesterday <br>
To post love letters today<br>
Thus we drift away from our kin<br>
Reveal our foolish weakness and greed<br><br>

We no more see us in a mirror<br>
We float away in loneliness of our balcony <br>
We are floating away bare in moonshine<br>
Long have we not held each other in arms<br>
Long have we not kissed each other<br>
Long have we not heard other sing<br>
Long have we not seen a carefree kid<br>
We are walking towards a forest older than the woods<br>
Where the eternal leaves left their marks on the rocks<br>
We are heading to a world void of contact <br><br>

Seen many a postman in the forest of Fall<br>
Their yellow bags filled like bovine belly<br>
Picked up old letters anew <br>
Those men in the forest of fall<br><br>
  
A letter drifts apart from a letter<br>
Never seen a tree going away from a tree.

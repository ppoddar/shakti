Still kept your favorite key  <br>
That was lost?<br>
Now how do you open the vault?<br><br>

Still have that spot on your chin?<br>
Felt sudden urge to write<br>
Before journey to a new land<br><br>

Kept the key with complete care<br>
For all these years<br>
<em>"Do you want it back?<br>
Please let me know."</em><br><br>

Your luminous face<br>
Awash with tears<br>
In memories' attic<br>
<em>"Do you want it back?<br>
Please let me know."</em>

Neighborhood asleep <br>
Doors shut tight<br>
Sudden knock of the dark:<br>
"Oboni, are you home?"<br><br>

Rains here around the year<br>
Bovine clouds roam<br>
Dejected tall green grass<br>
Grabs the door:<br>
"Oboni, are you home?"<br><br>

Faint pain latent in my heart<br>
I drowse. <br>
Sudden knock of the dark:<br>
"Oboni, are you home?"
